Use this command to run server. Needs to be this command because if not you will get import errors. This is because of the way that the models are imported

cd lyrix_backend
py -m uvicorn lyrix-server:app --reload

FOR MAC
python3 -m uvicorn lyrix-server:app --reload 


new terminal

cd lyrix_frontend
flutter run // ctrl F5
